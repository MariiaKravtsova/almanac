So I failed my first class, and it really shook the ground under my feet. My confidence levels have gone down, I was ashamed to tell my parents or anyone. The pain in my stomach, all the questions about my life and stamina in my head. Everything negative became more exaggerated. I still don’t know how I am going to get through my next semester that hasn’t even started yet. But I keep thinking and building things up in a bad light.

I have polled almost everyone I know, and most people had to re-take that one class. After talking to  so many people - it turns out that failure is part of it. Programmers often spend more time de-bugging then writing code, that is why so many people detach themselves from their code. Because if my code is just something I wrote then it doesn’t necessarily mean that I am stupid if it doesn’t work. It just mean I have to write it better. I have to improve it.

It has been fourteen days of my vacation (my parents have been visiting me), now it is over and I am getting back to the grind tomorrow. I am scared to fail a class again. Paying tuition and buying books was dreadful because I am investing in things that I might fail at. But here is a thing - if I do not learn to accept failure, then I will fail as a computer scientist. So the 2016 resolution is to stand up and smile in the face of each failure, to learn to enjoy each error and mistake. Big words, but I am going to start with small steps. I will try to keep my head down and not look at the big picture for right now.

Bring it on!
