My second batch of Soylent arrived today, and I am happy to see it. What is Soylent? A nutritional and
convenient way to replace a meal. They have more stuff on their website [silent.com](https://www.soylent.com/)

I am on Soylent 2.0. There is no worry about mixing it, no need to prep for anything, it tastes better
refrigerated, but I’ve had it room temperature and it was good as well. It is very clear to me what is inside the bottle - 400 calories.

My body requires 1,500. So if I have a good breakfast, some snack, Soylent for lunch and some healthy salad
for dinner - I am set for the day. If I am hungry and drifting off in class or while studying I can just have
a sip. It keeps me full. Since I don’t get hangry anymore - I am in better moods and can keep my focus longer.

A month later and I have lost 10 lbs. I cut my hair short, so maybe some loss are due to that. I am not
exercising, I have no intentions of loosing weight, I am just more mindful of how much and what goes in
my body. Hydration is also a key to success, my first week my body wasn’t found of all of these vitamins
coming in, but now it actually craves it.

I recycle the bottles and the boxes. My food waste has shrunk. Since the ingredients were not raised on a
vast land and with less waste and harm then farms I feel better about my decision. One of the selfish ways
to look at this - I am saving lots of money. I spend $58 on Soylent per month for 24 bottles ~ $2.42 per bottle.
Then I spend about $20-$30 per week and a half on groceries. This month I was eating out more then I should for
social reasons, but still I am under $150 for food. Last year I would spend around $250 on cafeteria lunches and
junk food. Saving money and not eating ramen is great!

Will I keep my subscription? You betcha.
Will I increase the amount of Soylent per day? Perhaps, but very gradually, I like cooking and tasting.
