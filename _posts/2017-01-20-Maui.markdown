So who is Maui? A demigod. Seriously the legend of Hawai'iloa is worth reading, or watching in the Disney version.

But in this case Maui is my computing beast. My classes require more computational power than my laptop was capable. Also, as soon to be CS graduate I had to fully immerse
myself into the Linux environment. So there I was, wanting something that will run my algorithms with n being large enough for me to draw the algorithm complexities. Also, it had to be sufficient for Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Because I am learning those!

The Macbook Pro took a while to run my handwritten number recognition neural net. Oh, I still miss Mac OS. Alright, so a good place to start is to talk to people. Ask what they are using, how they are runnning things. Then jump on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wD8CZ8) and add your stuff. That website is seriously amazing.

You can read about Maui's [insides](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wD8CZ8), but while you are doing that I want to say research, research, research before ordering the parts.

Once I got the parts I found [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_4F8DhPQ48&t=1027s) that used the same case as I did. Also [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bUghCx9iso) really knows what he is talking about. I watched a lot of videos on installing the chip and the cooling system. Putting the gooey looking stuff on my brand new chip was nerve racking. It took about eight hours, that include some breaks and lunch. It is basically an estimated time from unpacking to seeing a fresh Ubuntu screen.

One of my fans wasn't connected properly, but nothing burned yet, so here it is - 20 days and it is still working.

The temperature stays pretty nice and cool, and I don't hear it, or maybe don't notice it. I can now say that I can run things longer and faster, and I am really enjoying it.

This project proved me that I know some cool people who are willing to help me. I really do appreciate you guys.

One recent purchase for Maui was a [Bluetooth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Adapter so I can enjoy my headphones.

Live long and prosper, Maui.
