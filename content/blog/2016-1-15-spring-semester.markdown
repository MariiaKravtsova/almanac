Today ends the first week of the new semester for me. After a heavy loaded semester with a **lot** of computer science courses, I made a decision to get my schedule in a better equilibrium. I am still taking too many classes in numbers, but mentally they are easier to handle (I think so far).

* CS 1310 - Foundations of Computer Science (again, sadly)
* CS 2240 - System Programming Concepts
* PHYS 1050 - Stars and Galaxies Laboratory
* PHYS 1060 - Introduction to Stars and Galaxies
* PHIL 3160 - Ethics in Engineering and Technology
* MATH 162 - Calculus 2

Since I also have to maintain 30 hour work week, I chose to try Soylent 2.0. It is my lunch and occasional dinner replacement, I still eat other foods. So far it is going well. Another change that I am working on is my sleep schedule, the plan is to sleep 10:00pm to 4:30am, to be honest that is much more difficult to adjust since when I wake up it is still dark.

This year, I am striving to discipline myself, and develop good habits. To be honest I have lowered the bar of ambition for myself, because I shall work on the basics, and the rest will come much easier after that. Don't get disappointed just yet, I have some exciting projects in mind, and they are coming up soon.
