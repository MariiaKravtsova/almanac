During the winter break I read *Ada’s Algorithm: How Lord Byron’s Daughter Ada Lovelace Launched the Digital Age* by James Essinger.
I was impressed because Essinger disproves the theory that Ada was insane. She suffered great pain from cancer at the end of her life,
and she had to take opium with alcohol, but she was not insane or mentally ill.

I was astonished at how determined she was to study math. Can you imagine if she had access to such a stream of information as we do?
She would probably do some really cool things. She had the dilemma of “Science is not for a woman’s brain.” Not to spoil anything,
but her tutor actually refused to answer some of her questions because she would physically be unable to handle such answers.
He cautioned Lady Byron to allow Ada to pursue math.

However, Ada did splendid work, and arguably wrote the first computer program. She didn’t approach math as strictly sets of equations
which one need to apply to problems. Ada had an abundant imagination which she used to solve problems. The Difference Machine was much
more to her then what Babbage did, if only he accepted her offer they might have finished one of the machines.

Women like Ada are the ones inventing things, running companies, and being leaders in today’s world. Two hundred years later and we still
have too many of the same problems. I hope that we can change the stereotypes and get past the gender differences within the next 200 years,
but for now, let’s be a little more like Ada.
