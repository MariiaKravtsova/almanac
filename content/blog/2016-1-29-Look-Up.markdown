Neil DeGrasse Tyson always inspires us to look up. Understanding the heavens helps us understand how things around us work. In our day and age it is embarrassing to me that people still try to argue that the Earth is flat, instead of talking about why is sky blue? (shorter light wavelength), or why are sun sets orange? (longer light wavelength).

Science is so fascinating, you are missing out on so much if you are not asking questions... Here are some inspiring things to look at,
if you are even mildly interested in how the heavens and the world around us work. Our eyes are so powerful that on a clear night, with low light pollution we can see the closest to us galaxy - Andromeda. Plus there is an abundance of data that we have recorded and yet have to go through, which is what project zooniverse is for. I feel inspired and privileged to live on the spec every time I look up, read about how stuff works, or listen to smart people talking about what is up and how stuff works. Here is my favorite collection.
