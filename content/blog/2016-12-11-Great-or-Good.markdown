As per my last post here I went onto searching for grit. I told myself that if I can pick
something easy and make it a habit, then I can do anything. So for three months I went to
the gym every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Unfortunately, I had to stop because of uncertain
health issues, but I picked up reading on daily basis instead. So today I know that I do have grit,
if I put my mind to it.

A friend of mine asked me "Do you want to be good or do you want to be great?" Well, of course
I want to be great. Don't we all want to do what now seems the impossible?

Well, to do the impossible we first have to do what is possible every single day. We must
work on our dream because practice and perseverance is what makes one great. You'll be seeing me
more around here talking about my practice.
