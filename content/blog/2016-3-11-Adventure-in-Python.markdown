In the computer club I have met a few people, who have told me about the beauty of Python. For the past month I have been looking into it during free time, and I agree with all the Python lovers. The syntax is easy to read and write because it is basically using words kind of like pseudo code. There seems to be a library for everything. I havenâ€™t ventured much into them, but [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) seems pretty awesome.

I have been following the projects in [Automate The Boring Stuff with Python](automatetheboringstuff.com) by Al Sweigart, and it has been really fun. The book has some really good projects, the programs are pretty useful too. Sometimes I feel like I am in love with Python. The summer months I hope to really push myself to learn [Artificial intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0136042597/ref=rdr_ext_sb_pi_hist_1) using Python in my free time. There are a few open source projects that I would like to get my hands on.

The two branches of Computer Science that really strike me are web development and artificial intelligence. Watching the recent AlphaGo matches got me excited, I wanted to pop a bottle of champaign when the AlphaGo won. Because we won, the humans. Touring NASA facility in Houston and seeing the Robonauts made me proud of being a human as well. The possibilities of what I could do while standing on shoulders of giants are limitless.
