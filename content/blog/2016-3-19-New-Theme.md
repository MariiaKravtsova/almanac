I thought that this blog needed to look better, and more readable. However, time is difficult to find, so I just plopped a theme that looked good. Thank you to vormwald for dedicating your time on building a theme and sharing it with others. Making your work open source is a graceful thing to do, and it makes me feel safer living in this world of collaboration and free spirit.
