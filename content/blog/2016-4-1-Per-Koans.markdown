"Koans are riddles, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment." (Google)

A few very smart people created koans for all sort of programming languages and libraries. There are koans for Ruby, Python, Go, Rust...
I am very grateful to these people because they made learning and testing your knowledge fun. As of today I have completed JavaScript koans,
and about half way through Python ones. Testing the way functions behave is sometimes boring, and one can miss some of the capabilities.
Koans show you the functions at work, and you have to think through and put the expected result. Supplement koans with good book and documentation
and in my opinion you understand the language. Next step learn how to write in it.

There is a small detour I am taking from Artificial Intelligence and focusing on JavaScript and its frameworks. I am very excited about my productivity
app that I am building after I get better at Node and Angular, possibly even Underscore. Sometimes I feel in a rush to finish this project, but
since this is the end of the semester I am taking it slow and focusing on good basic knowledge.

Keep learning, try Koans!
