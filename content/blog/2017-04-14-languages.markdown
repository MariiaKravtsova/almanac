>“Experience with Python, Java, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and C.” 

Sounds sort of like a polyglot. But I had no other choice. The first time I was interested to program was to change something on a torrents tracker which was built in PHP, so I figured my way through CSS, HTML and PHP to make it pretty enough. Then, I made a website for my school using ucoz hosting, and also built some websites using WordPress. 

When I started taking programming classes at KVCC it was JavaScript, then Visual Basic, then C#. The only class I really enjoyed was the web design one using JavaScript. Although, I enjoyed learning about object oriented programming in my C# class, I thought objects, inheritance and recursion were mind blowing concepts that I will never be able to grasp well enough to think in them.

Then, it was time for big guns - transferring to Western Michigan University and juggling working in multiple languages each semester. There I picked up some R, C, Java, and Ruby. Most semesters started with “learn x language”, and then the rest “build all assignments in x language”. I really wish that I was allowed to pick my own language for some of the higher classes, because honestly I would stick with one or two. 

I want to pick one language and learn all the ins and outs of it. There is no such thing as complete knowledge of one thing in computer science, but I want to feel less of the noob in JavaScript or Python.
