Found my journal entries from two years ago when I just finished my first semester as CS student at WMU, failed a class, 
thought I will never become a developer, and wanted to quit school. Fast forward and I am done with school, I am starting 
my second job as a developer in a few weeks. I have fixed bugs, I have asked questions, I have created meaningful relationships,
and I have learned a lot of meaningful lessons. 

Some of the lessons I learned are ...

Whatever you do, don't be an asshole. It does not matter if you are smarter, prettier or superior in any way, nobody ever has an
excuse or a pass card to be an asshole. 

It is ok to dream big, but you have to work hard.

Don't listen to stereotypes about women, each person is unique and is capable of doing amazing things. 

Programmers are opinionated people, but if you like spaces or JavaScript, or C - use it, enjoy it, don't listen to the haters and don't be a hater.

Computer Science theory can be cool, sometimes you just have to find the right blog post, book or video to explain it in useful terms.

Some professors don't want to teach, learn anyway. Some group members don't want to do the work, do it anyway. 

Grades are not important, nobody is asking for my GPA in my interviews, mine is 3.21, and my student loan is only $7,000. See what I did there? 

Take time to rest, this field is very difficult mentally, so go to the gym, read a book, watch movies...

Be friends with your co-workers, go to lunch with them, learn their kid's names, be opened with them, at the end of the day we are all people, not titles.

Also, and this should probably be a different post - Don't be afraid to work at startups. Yeah maybe they are not stable financially, 
but the experience working with relevant technologies, on a product that evolves quickly... it's pretty exciting. All I am saying you should give it a try.
