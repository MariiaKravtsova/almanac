Working on a spanking new project, creating new files, deciding on patterns and styles... that is greenfield.

On the other hand, brownfield is working on fixing bugs, or adding new features to already bulky legacy code.

I know my definitions might romanticize one over another, I think that is how the industry sells us - the promise of creating something completely new.
Sometimes it forgets to mention the whole hard work and teamwork part. My mom still thinks I sit in alone in a dark room all day with my hoodie on and type away until my body
is done with all that coffee and RedBull.

Back to the point - so far I have mostly worked on new projects. I learned a lot, but mostly about technologies, and I would often feel
very accomplished with the number of lines in my PRs. Oh, and I can spend hours on how dangerous it is to look at those stats on Github, but in the name of science...

Quikly has been around for about five - six years and the code, wow, so MUCH CODE. I am new to Rails, but that is not the point, I feel lost in the files.
When I think I find the right file I put some logs, or a giant red box, refresh the page - nothing there... wrong file, then I start over again. In a way I am Sherlock Holmes,
and system search is my Watson.

*So it is all bad and nobody should ever work in legacy code?*
I am glad you asked, because we will all have to work with legacy code at some point, and it is not actually at all bad.

Maybe instead of calling it brownfield, I would call it goldmine.

This code has been worked on so many beautiful minds, with their own creative ways to solve a problem, their own signature styles. I can use those ways to solve a problem as guidance of how I can solve mine. Sometimes I am thinking how I can use property X from property Y, well, there is an already a stable, tested, possibly complicated method for that, just waiting for me. Oh and the tests - the mocks are already there, all I need is to add my case? Hell yeah, thank you!

Oh, someone is using this pattern of naming things - thanks!

There is a tricky builder that I can just use for this? Thanks!

Reading all those files, spending all that time looking for the right place to insert my one line of code, that is not a waste. That is me learning and becoming better prepared to start a fresh project when time comes.
