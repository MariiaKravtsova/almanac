This year, on February 15th I, and ninety or so other people declared our allegiance to the United States and became citizens of this great country. It was a beautiful ceremony, and the entire day was very emotional, and highly anticipated. Receiving my naturalization certificate made me feel like I finally fit in, like I finally am part of this country. I did not just obtain a paper, I obtained the right to participate in the democracy - I gained a voice.

This however does not change my roots, I come from Moldova, a country where people do not have much, but they manage. A Moldovian wedding is a three day fest, regardless of our GDP - we know how to relax.

My point is: this is where I am, and that is where I came from. It took me nine years to grow, to fail, to succeed, and now I really want to give back because I am so grateful for every person I have met, and every opportunity I have received. I wish someone helped me understand how I could give back, or pay forward, after all I thought only rich or significant people can make a difference. Oh, how wrong I was. Here are a few things most people can do to help others:

- You are good at something, why not teach someone else that skill. There are mentorship programs like Girls Who Code, Code Apprentice, help someone at Free Code Camp.
- Go to your local meetups, meet people and listen to them.
- Help organize an event.
- Make a meaningful purchase. For example: need a water bottle? 4 Ocean will get 1 pound of trash out of the ocean; Ten Tree will plant ten trees, and the clothes will be made of wood.
- Run or walk a race, do a virtual race if you would like to do it with a friend that's far away, or you are too busy to go to an event.
- Attend an event where you can win a raffle or where the proceeds from ticket sale will be donated.
- Leave books you finished reading on park benches or little libraries.
- Give a loan through Kiva.
- Donate. Of course you can always donate clothes, things you no longer use, or money (Malala Fund and Lumos are the ones I strongly care about).
- If none of those things appeal to you, you can tighten your circle and invite friends over and cook a hearty meal for them.

From my experience people want to be respected and heard. I am far from the person I wish I could be, and I have an enormous amount to yet still learn in this world, but I am sure of one thing - you matter. We all matter, and what we do matter. So let's do something good, something hopeful every day.
