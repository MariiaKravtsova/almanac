In 2018 I traveled to...

* D.C.

* Niagara Falls

* Iceland

* Denmark

* Sweden

* Romania

* Moldova

* Austin

* Las Vegas

* Grand Canyon

* New York City

Impressive list? Maybe, but that was as close to a gap year as I have gotten to. I was in school on and off for 6 years. I maintained a full time student status and worked 30-40 hours a week for 2 years. My first development job was at a startup that lost funding. I was burnt out from information and from books, videos that were trying to teach me something. My curiosity never went away, it was just not as exciting to learn.

So I took tome trips to see friends that I talk with almost every week, and some trips to see friends I have not seen or talked in years. I also went "home".

Being in a place where you grew up really puts where you are at now in perspective. It might shut up your imposter syndrome for a while because you get the feeling "I did work hard". At the same time it's a humbling experience of "I couldn't have possibly done it without all these people and a little bit of luck".

Seeing my childhood friends and complaining about the same things, sharing stories that are so similar. I felt less alone in the pressure that I get from my parents to get married for example. I also felt like our work struggles are about the same, even though our professions are very different, our countries of living are miles apart.

Meeting strangers can be great! Denmark and Sweden are rated very highly on world's happiness scale. On my flights I was learning about Hygge and Lagom, and I had a chance to experience both. Hygge is Denmark's secret and it's about togetherness. Lagom is Sweden's secret of just having/doing enough. Be it at the AirBnB or a bench near a church I was lucky to have a conversations with some locals and learn more about their daily lives, and what philosophies they live by. I think I found a good balance of reading books and living it, and I brought home these perspectives with me. I started decluttering my apartment, my schedule. Going out on walks more, meeting up with friends for activities, cooking together, making drinks together.

There is absolutely nothing I can say to explain how Grand Canyon made me feel.

Traveling forces me to be curious. It puts my problems in perspective, helps me set them to the side and enjoy life. The tall buildings in NYC, the Hoover Dam, the islands of Copenhagen prove me that humans can indeed get shit done and I should be more generous and patient with people. Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, dark skies teach me to appreciate things that I am not part of, because at the end of it all, nobody will remember me or what I did.

I know everyone's advice is to save money and contribute to 401(k). Please do that. But if you find yourself in need of fresh perspective, excitement, or if something is troubling you - get out of the city you live in. Take a long weekend. See a friend. Take a chance on a new destination.
