# week 4

## [Technical Debt - The code monster in everyone's closet by Nina Zakharenko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKYktDRoRxw)

Common causes: unneeded complexity, time crunch, lack of understanding.

Creates: culture of despair.

Signs that you have it: code smells, poor docs, architecture & design smells, circular dependencies.

Really great case studies - sometimes you have to burn with fire. 

Don't point fingers. Work together. Pair program. Code reviews. Stay accountable. Prioritize. Shelf life.

## [Top-level Awaiting for Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpb9nY0WPao)

Rich Harris Top-Level Await is a footgun tl;dr:

- Top level await can block execution
- Fetching resources over network would be blocked
- No interop support for common.js
- Cycles could introduce deadlock

ECMA 262 is a spec, EC 39 is the committee that decides changes to JS.

## [What Can We Learn With JavaScript Fatigue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZkeMvg6DfY)

 People forget that software solves business problems.

Most bugs are caused by bad design.

TDD is about taking gradual steps toward a solution.

[The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz.](https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/149151423X)

Learn things as you go (as problems come up)

Don't feel too attached to a single technology, or define yourself as your tech stack.

Do things that don't scale to see if they really matter.

Don't get ahead of yourself. 

Be a town planer.

## [CSS Grid In Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPaYUjD_Fp4)

Defining a grid for your specific app is very useful, and because of the consistent syntax the CSS becomes much more maintainable and responsive.

Use Grid Inspector add-on in your browser.

Make the container element to do all the work. 

For optimization you can insert the fallback stylesheet only on the browsers that don't support grid.

## [Hitchhikers Guide to Web Standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvQ5l4Adkc)

Standard in this context is a document specifying observable effects of tech with multiple independent implementations.

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group and W3C are the groups making the standards for Web API Platform.

There are two parts to the standards: algorithms, look and feel.

Web IDL is an abstraction of ECMAScript text (sheriff) used for these standards.

Borders are not always rectangles.
