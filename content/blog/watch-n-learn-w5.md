## [RubyConf 2018 - Eiffel's Tower by Nickolas Means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RslVT-L2A40)

Every organization is political. It doesn't have to be negative and gross. 

Networking and self promotions are necessary as well, look at them as making friends and telling stories.

Negotiation is just cooperation, working together to find outcome that works for everyone.

You Can Negotiate Anything by Cohen

Choose to participate in office politics in the way that is true to you instead of running to another company which will most likely have the same problems because that is how the Eiffel towers are built. By sticking around long enough and working through all the problems no matter how big they are.

## [RubyConf 2018 - Practical guide to benchmarking your optimizations by Anna Gluszak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FapHqq5kU_Y)

Benchmarking is running old code and new code and comparing the time it took against each other.

Random sampling - eliminates bias by random data pick out of a bag 

Stratified sampling - sampling by group, proportionally or disproportionally.

Clustering sampling - divide into groups and pick one cluster/group. (cheaper)

Systematic random sampling - picking every nth element of the population

Multi-stage - combining samplings from above. 

Things that slow things: loops, recursion, require a lot of things, observers and callbacks.

Show proof to your co-workers that the code is actually optimized.

## [MPJ - Asking for help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe1ZAy2yNvE)

3 different approaches:

1. Having no help when you are thrown at the code and you are all alone
2. Buddy system (someone has time allocated for your questions)
3. Pair programming

Encourage people to ask for help, don't show your annoyance.

Most companies don't have a security team, so you have to make risk assessments all the time. As a team you have to track the security issues that you care about.

## [A Brief History of GraphQL by the Creator of GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-OizdRJh1U)

The FB newsfeed was super slow with REST. So GraphQL queries ask exactly what they need, and GraphQL types minimize things breaking. Also automated docs are useful for new users of the codebase. 

GraphQL Foundation is going to be a group to keep improving the open source product.

## [Teaching CSS to JavaScripters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGNZwCu0x8Q)

CSS gives you more elegance and speed, but JS gives you more control.

Possibly important CSS topics: selectors, layouts, box model, cascading and variable scope, inheritance, media queries, units, positioning and viewports

## [The State of CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrpG8a_yVb4)

There is not enough communication between design and development which has created problems. 

Device queries and media queries to incorporate in different browsers.

Pre-processors has become famous to create complex styled apps, but with time and CSS improvements developers are actually moving away from them because of component based systems.

Grid gives you control to place components horizontally and vertical.

File structure is one of the pain points, Sass solves this problem with imports. 

Houdini is a set of browser API to create dynamic variables, default syntaxes, Paint API.
