## [MPJ - How do you prepare before tackling a problem?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF-tVjXbO8Y)

To deal with procrastination: 

- Time boxing
- Know why you are doing something
- Hyperfocus helps sometimes

Prepare to tackle the problem:

- Understand the background and intent of the task
- Provide simpler solutions to the product people if there is a simpler/faster way
- Get insight from other devs, product people
- Writing tests cases will help you understanding all the intricacies instead of just writing code for happy and unhappy paths
- Refinement is better than upfront thinking, don't write best code immediately

"I have succeeded at what I'm doing because I am stubborn and oblivious." 

"People should have to be thick-skinned to succeed at software"

We should strive to be determined and empathetic. 

 How you act is what your values are, how you talk is what you want me to think your values are.

The standard you walk past, is the standard that you accept.

## [MPJ - What task would make today great?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2KbMeS9lLQ)

Come up with a task that answer the question. 

Because even if you do a bunch of better habits and stuff, that still might not be enough to make a day great.

Ask yourself "How would you practice this?" when setting a goal.

You might question if that is really the right task, but it might be good to stick with it.

Evening is best to decide for this task, because you've internalized where the day is going to take you.

## [RxJS Top Ten - Code This, Not That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewcoEYS85Co)

RxJS is a powerful, functional approach for dealing with events and with integration points into a growing number of frameworks, libraries, and utilities, the case for learning Rx has never been more appealing.

1. observable is a subscriber, pipe for data
2. schedulers add sync/async behavior 
3. Hot observables can have multiple subscriptions
4. Subjects are hot observables but you can add values to it after it has been instantiated
5. Operators help you control the flow going through the observables
6. Tap allows you to trigger side effects
7. Backpressure is an observable that emits more events than it needs
8. Switchmap allows you to start with one observable, and then switch to another one
9. Catch errors and then emit some default value
10. Retry operator
11. Memory leaks can be prevented by unsubscribing from the subscription, or use takeWhile  wrapper.

## [React.js in 2019 & Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWfHTLm6ECQ)

Render DOM elements efficiently.

There are a lot of dependencies that big project depend on. 

Hooks allow you to only write functional components, and now you can share logic between components that is decoupled from those components.

Concurrent Mode (performance) and Suspense (code splitting) is coming in 2019.
